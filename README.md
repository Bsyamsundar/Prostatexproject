Master's Project: ProstateX Dataset - Finding the Clinsing Score

Project Overview:

This project involves the analysis of the ProstateX dataset to find the clinsing score. Prostate MRI images are included in the ProstateX dataset, which is a popular dataset used in medical imaging research. This project aims to create a way to use the given data to determine the clinsing score.

Dataset:

The dataset can be accessed from the following link: https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/prostatex/

Downloading the Dataset:

I have downloaded the dataset as specified in the detailed description provided on the above link. Due to the large size of the dataset, I have decided to focus my project on the T2-weighted images, although the dataset includes four categories of images.
The categories are 
T2-weighted (used in the project),
DWI (Diffusion-Weighted Imaging),
Ktrans (Kinetics),
ADC (Apparent Diffusion Coefficient).
